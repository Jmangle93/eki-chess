# Chess engine and simple web interface
This is a project to produce a simple chess engine written in Python. It uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to search the game tree. The engine is able to play against itself or against a human player. It is starting as a command line program but I plan to extend it to include a simple web interface.
